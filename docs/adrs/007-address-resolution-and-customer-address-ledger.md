## Context

[ADR 005](005-canonical-service-address-model.md) made `service_locations` the canonical service
address (one row per physical place, identity = Google `place_id`) and moved ownership to the
`customer_service_addresses` link table. It also set the resolution method (Autocomplete candidates
+ a pick — a human in the in-app dropdown, or an automated picker for bulk) and said the address
should flow through `upsert_service_location` **at ingestion**. It left three things unspecified:

1. **How do non-form creates get a `place_id`?** The form supplies one (the staff picks from the
   Google Autocomplete dropdown). Every other path — ION ingestion, the nightly QBO sync, the API,
   walk-ins — arrives with a *raw* address string and no `place_id`. Today we assume one exists.
2. **Where do un-resolvable addresses live?** ADR 005 left ~850 customers on `place_id`-NULL
   `service_locations` rows (the rooftop-only cleanup). Holding "we don't know the canonical address
   yet" as a half-formed `service_locations` row pollutes the canonical list.
3. **What enforces the write discipline?** Three writers bypass the model today (the QBO ShipAddr
   sync, ION ingestion, lead intake), each able to blind-`INSERT` a `service_locations` row.

## Decision

Two structural moves.

### 1. `service_locations` is a clean canonical list, written through one door

- **`upsert_service_location` requires a non-null `place_id`** (rejects null) and enforces the
  ADR-005 invariant as a CHECK: `place_id IS NOT NULL ⟺ geocode_status = 'ok'`. It becomes a pure
  "store this *confirmed* place" primitive — it can no longer create a half-row.
- **All writes to `service_locations` go through the customer create/edit path** (the composer
  below). No path blind-INSERTs an address.

### 2. `customer_service_addresses` becomes the address ledger (link + history + resolution queue)

A join row is no longer a minimal tuple; it is the **durable record of "this customer claimed this
address,"** and *resolution* is a property that fills in over time. The row never moves tables.

```
customer_service_addresses
  customer_id              -> Customers
  service_location_id      -> service_locations    NULLABLE (null = not yet resolved)
  raw_street/city/state/zip   the address as entered (provenance + the human's context)
  source                   lead | ion | qbo_ship | qbo_billing_fallback | manual
  resolution_status        pending | resolved | needs_review | duplicate
  is_active                current vs prior owner of the address
  created_at               when the customer first claimed this address (the history axis)
  resolved_at              when service_location_id was set
```

The row's **natural identity is `(customer_id, normalized_raw_address)`** — present from creation,
in every state. `service_location_id`/`place_id` is the resolution that gets written in. This is
why "upgrade in place" works: you find the row by raw address and set the location; you never create
a parallel resolved row. The raw address is normalized with the same `normalize_address` used for
the active-address partial unique, so `"123 Main St"` and `"123 MAIN STREET"` collapse to one row.

#### Row lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> pending : claimed (raw address, no place_id)
  pending --> resolved : auto-pick confident + not already linked
  pending --> needs_review : auto-pick found no confident match
  pending --> duplicate : resolved, but customer already links this place
  needs_review --> pending : raw address corrected (an edit)
  needs_review --> resolved : human picks in the dropdown
  duplicate --> [*] : human deletes the redundant row
  resolved --> [*]
```

Text fallback:
- **pending** — claimed, no `place_id` yet (untried, or a transient Google failure). The *only*
  state the drain job retries.
- **resolved** — `service_location_id` set; done.
- **needs_review** — Autocomplete ran and found no confident pick → a human resolves it via the
  dropdown (or a corrected raw address resets it to `pending`). Never auto-retried on the same input.
- **duplicate** — it *did* resolve, but to a place the customer already links → the row is left
  unresolved and tagged; a human deletes it. (See constraints.)

### 3. The resolve pipeline (a shared function the composer calls)

`resolveServiceAddress(rawAddress)` is one function with three callers (the composer, the drain job,
the human-pick UI). It runs the ADR-005 "candidates + agreement-guard pick": Places Autocomplete →
pick the prediction whose house-number + corrected street + in-area city all agree → Place Details →
return a `ResolvedAddress { place_id, canonical street/city/state/zip, lat, lng, geocode_status:'ok' }`,
or **none** when nothing agrees confidently (never a guessed `place_id` — the "magnet centroid" trap).

- **Runs around the DB transaction, not inside it** — an external HTTP call must not hold a Postgres
  lock while it waits on Google. The composer resolves, *then* opens the txn to upsert + write the row.
- **Sync-or-defer mode.** Interactive callers (lead form, walk-in) resolve **synchronously** so the
  user sees immediately whether the address pinned. Bulk callers (ION/QBO nightly sync of thousands)
  pass `defer`: insert `pending` rows and let the drain job resolve them in batches (rate-limited) —
  never thousands of inline Google sessions in a request.
- **Google unreachable ≠ no match.** A timeout / 5xx leaves the row `pending` (retry), never blocking
  the create. Only a confident *no-match* is `needs_review`.

### 4. The drain job

A Windmill job (the backstop, like `recover_orphan_tasks`) selects **`service_location_id is null and
resolution_status = 'pending'`** only. It never re-runs `needs_review` (same input → same answer,
wasted spend) or touches `duplicate`. A `needs_review` row gets another attempt only when its input
changes (an edit → reset to `pending`). An optional, explicit "sweep `needs_review`" job can catch
Google improving over time, but that is never the regular drain.

### 5. Constraints

| Constraint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `unique(customer_id, normalized_raw_address)` | no duplicate *claims* of the same input (e.g. a nightly ION re-sync) |
| `unique(customer_id, service_location_id) where service_location_id is not null` | no duplicate *links* to one place. When resolving a pending row would hit this (two raw spellings → one `place_id`), **the resolve is rejected, the row stays `pending` and is tagged `duplicate`**, and a human deletes it (UI affordance). |
| `unique(service_location_id) where is_active and service_location_id is not null` | the ADR-005 invariant — at most one *active* customer per resolved address (only enforceable post-resolution). |
| **no** per-customer cap | a customer may hold several active service links (commercial / POA with multiple pools/sites). |

### 6. Service-address source priority + billing fallback

Billing and service are **two different addresses**: the *billing* address stays on the QBO/Customer
record; the ledger holds only *service* addresses. Each ingesting caller picks the best raw service
address and stamps `source`:

1. **ION** `ion.recurring_tasks.service_address` — authoritative for maintenance customers (ADR 005).
2. **QBO `ShipAddr`** — the customer's shipping/service address.
3. **QBO `BillAddr`** (fallback) — when `ShipAddr` is empty, use the billing address as the service
   address, stamped `source = qbo_billing_fallback`. For most residential customers billing == service,
   so this is correct and worth resolving automatically; the stamp is what lets a data-quality check
   surface "service inferred from billing — verify" for commercial / property-manager accounts where
   billing ≠ service.

### 7. A city is required to geocode; billing is never a geocode hint (2026-06-21)

**Failure mode found.** `service_locations` are born street-only from the visits ingester
(`f/ION/_lib/upsert`) — it get-or-creates by normalized *street*, landing no city/ZIP. The geocoder
then filled the gap by (a) bounds-biasing the bare street to the service area and (b) falling back to
the customer's **billing** city when the service city was null. Both are wrong: a bare "375 40th
Street" geocoded with the SE-GA bounds resolves to a *same-named street in a wrong major city*
(Savannah / Statesboro), and billing is the **mailing** address — often a PO box in another town (an
Eastman PO box for a Sea Island pool). The result was confident-but-wrong rooftops stamped `ok` — ~8
maintenance pools mislocated 60–90 mi from their route (FOSTER/STUCKEY/REHLAENDER → "Savannah",
REGAN → "Statesboro", SHEFFIELD → "Fayetteville"). ION had the correct city/ZIP the whole time
(`ion.recurring_tasks` — Sea Island 31561, St Simons 31522); the pipeline just never landed it.

**Decision.**
- **City is required.** `geocode_service_locations` and `resolveServiceAddress` no longer geocode a
  city-less address — they return `needs_review`. A street with no city is unverifiable; flag it, don't
  guess. (Mirrored in both the Python geocoder and the TS resolver; keep them in sync.)
- **Billing is never a geocode hint.** Drop the `s_city or b_city` fallback. Billing ≠ service (§6);
  using it to *locate* a pool is what produced the PO-box pins.
- **ION is the city/ZIP authority.** `f/ION/reconcile_service_addresses` (scheduled) lands
  `ion.recurring_tasks` city/state/zip onto the `service_location`: **fill** null cities, and **correct**
  rows whose stored ZIP-region *and* city both disagree with ION (overwrite + drop the wrong pin +
  `needs_review` to re-pin). The "city must also differ" guard avoids ION's own ZIP anomalies. This
  runs on the ingestion cadence so a street-only row gets ION's city before the geocoder sees it.

Net: a wrong city/ZIP from a bad geocode is corrected from ION automatically; an address ION can't
resolve to a rooftop (e.g. a Sea Island cottage) lands in `needs_review` for the in-app editor
(`/maintenance/customers/[id]`) — never a silent wrong pin. The sharp wrong-address detector is
"stored ZIP-region ≠ ION's", not the broader far-from-route heuristic (which also catches legit
spread-out routes).

### 8. Office is ONE geographic value, derived from the service location (2026-06-21)

Office (the servicing branch: Brunswick / Richmond Hill / Saint Marys / Savannah) was assigned three
ways: `Customers.office_id` via `resolve_office` on the **billing** coordinate (wrong for snowbirds,
null when billing isn't geocoded); the routing UI read the **deprecated** `maintenance.task_schedules.office`
(null on ~41 customers → "Unassigned"); and `work_orders.office_name` was a free-text ION column. Three
vocabularies, and the routing tool used the worst.

**Decision.** Office is the nearest `branches` row to the **service location's own** rooftop coordinate
— one geographic value, the single source of truth:
- `service_locations.office_id` (+ `office_distance_mi`), set by a trigger from `resolve_office(lat,lng)`
  whenever the coordinate or `geocode_status` changes, **gated on `geocode_status = 'ok'`**. So an
  unresolved address has no office — "no office" ⟺ "needs address fix" (the banner population, §7).
- `Customers.office_id` re-derived from the customer's representative service location (was billing).
- The routing views (`maintenance.v_routes_summary`, `public.v_route_stops`) read the geographic branch
  via `service_locations.office_id`, not `task_schedules.office`. Office labels = `split_part(branches.name, ',', 1)`.

Result: 462/474 active maintenance customers resolve to a geographic office; the remaining 12 are exactly
the unresolved-address set the banner surfaces. The deprecated `task_schedules.office` is no longer read
by routing. **Follow-up:** the maintenance *customers* and *visits* lists still group by the old office
(`v_task_schedules_with_context.office` / ION visit office) — repoint those to the geographic office too.

### 9. Office lives on the CUSTOMER and the TECH — never denormalized (2026-06-21)

§8 made office geographic, but it still has to answer two different questions, so it lives in exactly two
places and everything else **joins** to one of them (no copies onto tasks / schedules / visits / work orders
— a copy is a thing to keep in sync and get wrong):

- **Customer office** — `Customers.office_id`, the nearest branch to the customer's representative service
  address, but **manually overridable**. `recompute_customer_office()` derives it; a trigger on
  `service_locations` keeps it fresh on any re-geocode / edit / merge; `set_customer_office` /
  `clear_customer_office_override` set or release a sticky override (`office_overridden` — the auto-recompute
  skips an overridden row). This is the office for **customer** queries/filtering.
- **Tech office** — `employees.branch_id` (the tech belongs to a branch). This is the office for **routes**.

**A route is `tech × day`, so a route's office is the TECH's office** — independent of which office each
customer belongs to. The routing views group/filter by the tech's branch, not the customer's or the pool's.
A stop where the **customer's** office ≠ the **route/tech's** office is the meaningful *cross-office* signal
(distinct from §7's distance-based *wrong-address* signal). Because office sits on just customer and tech,
filtering "by office" works from either side and survives either one changing, with no multi-table update.

Implemented in passes: customer office + override + sync + UI (this migration); routing views repointed to
the tech's branch + per-stop customer-office + cross-office flag, and the customers/visits lists repointed to
the customer office (next).

## Consequences

**Good:**
- `service_locations` is a clean canonical list — real `place_id`s only, one write door, no half-rows.
- The full customer↔address history lives in one ledger (`created_at` timeline, `is_active` = current,
  cross-owner history per address) — no separate queue table; the "needs address" list is just
  `service_location_id is null`, with the raw address shown for context, filtered by status into
  "resolve" (needs_review) vs "delete" (duplicate) actions in `/customers/data-quality`.
- Every creation path — form, ION, QBO, API, walk-in — gets identical resolve + dedup + flag
  treatment, with no bypass, because the composer is the single choke point.
- Interactive creates get immediate pinned/needs-a-human feedback; bulk drains in the background.
- A customer is **always** created (billing address is the fallback) — only the service *link* lags
  when the address can't auto-resolve.

**Costs / risks:**
- An interactive create pays a ~200–500 ms Google round-trip; acceptable (the user is waiting and
  wants the result), and the call sits around the transaction, not inside it.
- Making `upsert_service_location` reject null forces every current null-passing writer (form
  free-text fallback, ION ingestion, the nightly QBO `ShipAddr` sync, lead intake) through the
  composer — this is ADR 005 Phase 4 and must be done before the reject-null lands, or those writers
  break. The legacy ~850 `place_id`-NULL rows are grandfathered (forward-only change); they can be
  swept into the ledger as `pending` later.
- Billing-as-service is wrong for commercial / property-manager accounts; the `qbo_billing_fallback`
  stamp is the safeguard (auditable, surfaceable), not a silent conflation.

## Implementation (forward)

1. [done] Migration: `customer_service_addresses` gains `raw_*`, `source`, `resolution_status`,
   `created_at`, `resolved_at`; `service_location_id` made nullable; `v_addresses_needing_resolution`.
   (Substrate PR. The three uniques are not all added yet — they land with reject-null in step 2.)
2. [pending] `upsert_service_location`: reject null `p_place_id` + the `place_id ⟺ geocode_status='ok'`
   CHECK + the three uniques. **Must come last** — every null-passing writer (ION, QBO ShipAddr sync)
   has to route through the resolver first, or it breaks. For now `create_account` forwards
   `geocode_status='ok'` to `upsert_service_location` whenever a `place_id` is supplied, so the
   invariant holds on the resolved path without yet rejecting nulls.
3. [done] `resolveServiceAddress` (shared) — `lib/places/resolve.ts`, a TS port of
   `f/google_maps/geocode_service_locations.fuzzy_resolve` (strict geocode → precision gate →
   guarded fuzzy → `ok | out_of_area | needs_review`). TS surface: `POST /api/places/resolve`.
4. [partial] `resolveServiceAddress`-backed composer. **Lead intake is wired** (`lib/leads/intake.ts`
   resolves the service address synchronously before `create_account`, passing `place_id` + canonical
   coords; a miss leaves the location `place_id`-NULL for the existing backfill/Address-QA flow and
   never blocks the lead). ION ingestion and the QBO ShipAddr sync still to route through it.
5. [pending] Drain job over `pending`; `v_addresses_needing_resolution` (status-split) feeding
   `/customers/data-quality`.
